# Instagram-Raffle
Python script to comment many times on a post to win an instagram raffle.

The idea of the script was to create a program that could mimic a person trying to comment many times on a post without raising red flags from instagram's ban policy. To do so the program focuses on moving the mouse and keyboard in a humanly manner. 

To be able to **execute** it you must first **edit** it and chose your own list of friends to tag, link to the instagram post and the location of your safari icon for the program to be able to open it.
